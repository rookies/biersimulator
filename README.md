biersimulator
=============

A just-for-fun "beer brewing simulator", in German language.

This was a project for the computer science class in school, so it's pretty
dirty code.
Please don't use it for any real beer brewing, as it implements some real
formulas but is not very useful.

You need Python 2 (Yeah, I know, I'm sorry...) and PyGTK.
Just run `./main.py` to start it.
